# The OSU Text Workshop Repository

This is the Github repository for the one-day workshop on Quantitative Text Analysis, taught at the School of Public Policy at Oregon State University, January 19, 2023. Here you will find slides, data, computer code, reading materials, and other details about the workshop. 

Above, you will find (hopefully) intuitively-labeled folders containing those workshop materials. There is also a document, "Useful R Resources," containing a host of links to resources for people new to the R language for statistical computing and graphics. 

In addition, in the "Code" folder above is a file named "OSU-2023-R-Intro.R." That is a plain-text file that is a short, *very* basic introduction to the R language. The best thing to do with that file is to (a) download and install the local/desktop version of RStudio (available at https://www.rstudio.com/), and (b) open the "OSU-2023-R-Intro.R" file in RStudio. The workshop will also begin with a brief, hopefully-not-too-painful introduction to the R language.
