# The OSU Text Workshop Repository

This is the Github repository for the one-day workshop on Quantitative Text Analysis, taught at the School of Public Policy at Oregon State University, January 6, 2022. Here you will find slides, data, computer code, and other details about the workshop. 

Above, you will find (hopefully) intuitively-labeled folders containing those workshop materials. There is also a document, "Useful R Resources," containing a host of links to resources for people new to the R language for statistical computing and graphics.
