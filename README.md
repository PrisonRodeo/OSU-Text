# The OSU Text Workshop Repository

This is the Github repository for the one-day workshop on Quantitative Text Analysis, taught at the School of Public Policy at Oregon State University, January 19, 2023. Here you will (eventually!) find slides, data, computer code, reading materials, and all other details about the workshop. 

Above, you will find (hopefully) intuitively-labeled folders containing those workshop materials. At the moment, I'd draw your attention to two documents: 

 - "Introduction to R," a set of (PDF-format) slides that introduce the reader to the R statistical language, the RStudio user interface, and some other aspects of R; and
 
 - "Useful R Resources," which contains a host of links to resources for people new to the R language for statistical computing and graphics. 

In addition, in the "Code" folder above is a file named "OSU-2023-R-Intro.R." That is a plain-text file that is a short, *very* basic introduction to the R language. The best thing to do with that file is to (a) download and install the local/desktop version of RStudio (available at https://posit.co/, formerly https://www.rstudio.com/), and (b) open the "OSU-2023-R-Intro.R" file in RStudio. Alternatively, navigate to https://posit.cloud/ (the new-ish name for RStudio Cloud), create a free account, and you can begin using RStudio in the cloud via any modern browser. More detailed instructions are available in the "Introduction to R" slides above. Once you've done that, (1) read through the file once; (2) read through it again, running each of the examples.

Beyond this, the "Homework" folder contains a few assignments I use to familiarize people with basic data management, etc. in R. Feel free to work on them if you think they would be useful.

Finally, the workshop will also begin with a brief, hopefully-not-too-painful introduction to the R language.
